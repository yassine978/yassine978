## 📚 About Me

I’m a passionate and curious data enthusiast with a strong foundation in data analysis, currently pursuing a **Master’s in Big Data & Artificial Intelligence** at **Université Paris Dauphine | Tunis**.

Previously, I earned my **Business Intelligence degree from ISG Tunis**, where I built solid experience in working with structured data, visualization, and predictive modeling.

My journey is shaped by a deep interest in solving real-world problems through data. I’ve participated in Kaggle competitions, academic projects, and AI-based applications — including building:

- 🧠 A CatBoost-based regression model for house price prediction
- 🎮 Data analysis pipelines on Twitch streamers and gaming behavior
- ♻️ A GPT-powered chatbot to guide companies in CSR strategies (hackathon project)

I’m now looking forward to combining my analytical skills with advanced machine learning and AI expertise to deliver smart, scalable solutions — either as a **Data Scientist**, **AI Engineer**, or **ML Engineer** in the near future.
