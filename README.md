- 🔎 Designed tailored recommendation systems using collaborative and content-based filtering

Currently, I am working as a **freelancer IT consultant** at a start-up, **ScribLogik**, collaborating to deliver scalable data and AI solutions for business growth.

My strengths:
- End-to-end data pipelines: cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, ML modeling, deployment
- Real-world dataset mastery & competition experience
- Fast learning, collaborative spirit, ethical approach to AI

**My vision:**  
To innovate at the intersection of data, AI, and real business impact—aspiring to grow as a Data Scientist, AI Engineer, or ML Engineer.
